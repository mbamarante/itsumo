This an introductory document to show how to use the framework for running DBA on the examples, and showing the problems in the GUI.

Running DBA: ./runDBA.sh targets/400/60/targets-0.txt sensors/sensors-400.txt 0 0 1

This executes DBA on the example problem from targets/400/60/targets-0.txt (the target configuration), in the sensor grid specified by sensors/sensors-400.txt

The GUI has a good number of options, please feel free to try them out.
