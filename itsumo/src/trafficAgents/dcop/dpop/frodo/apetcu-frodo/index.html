beginabstract
par
We present a framework for distributed combinatorial optimization.
The framework is implemented in Java, and simulates a multiagent environment in a single Java virtual machine.
Each agent in the environment is executed asynchronously in a separate execution thread, and communicates with its peers through message exchange.
par
The framework is highly customizable, allowing the user to implement and experiment with any distributed optimization algorithm.
par
Support for synchronous/asynchronous message passing, monitoring and statistics, as well as problem visualization tools are provided.
par
A number of distributed algorithms are already implemented in this framework, like the Distributed Breakout Algorithm citeyokoo95distributed and the DPOP Algorithm citePetcu2005.
par
A number of random evaluation problems are also provided, from two distinct domains: meeting scheduling and resource allocation in a sensor network.
endabstract
sectionIntroduction
Constraint satisfaction and optimization are powerful paradigms that model a large range of tasks like scheduling, planning, optimal process control, etc.
Traditionally, such problems were gathered into a single place, and a centralized algorithm was applied in order to find a solution.
However, problems are sometimes naturally distributed, so Distributed Constraint Satisfaction (DisCSP) was formalized by Yokoo in citeyokoo92distributed.
These problems are divided between a sent of agents, which have to communicate among themselves to solve them.
par
DisCSP has a number of practical advantages over its centralized counterpart.
Centralized solving may be inappropriate due to privacy and data integration problems.
Dynamic systems are another reason: by the time we manage to centralize the problem, it has already changed.
par
To address distributed optimization, complete algorithms like OptAPO and ADOPT have been recently introduced.
ADOPT citeModi03 is a backtracking based bound propagation mechanism.
It operates completely decentralized, and asynchronously.
The downside is that it may require a very large number of messages, thus producing big communication overheads.
OptAPO citeMailler355 centralizes parts of the problem; it is unknown apriori how much needs to be centralized where, and privacy is an issue. On the positive side, its communication requirements may be not that extreme.
par
Distributed local search methods like DSA (citekirkpatrick83optimization) / DBA(citezhang03dbarelax) for optimization, and DBA for satisfaction (citeyokoo95distributed) start with a random assignment, and then gradually improve it.
Sometimes they produce good results with a small effort.
However, they offer no guarantees on the quality of the solution, which can be arbitrarily far from the optimum.
Termination is only clear for textitsatisfaction problems, and only if a solution was found.
par
textitDPOP (see citePetcu2005) is a dynamic programming based algorithm that generates a linear number of messages.
However, in case the problems have high induced width, the messages generated in the high-width areas of the problem become too large.
par
There have been proposed a number of variations of this algorithm that address this problem and other issues, offering various tradeoffs (see citePetcu2005a,Petcu2005b,Petcu2005c,Petcu2005d,Petcu2005e,Petcu2005f.
citePetcu2005c proposes an approximate version of this algorithm, which allows the desired tradeoff between solution quality and computational complexity.
An anytime algorithm is also presented, which provides increasingly accurate solutions while the propagation is still in progress.
This makes it suitable for very large, distributed problems, where the propagations may take a long time to complete.

In this paper we deal with unary and binary relations; the extension to higher arity relations is shown in citePetcu2005f.
In a MCOP, any value combination is allowed; the goal is to find an assignment <IMG

par
The Environment class provides low level functionality like communication/message passing, loading/distribution of problem/subproblems, etc, much like the equivalent of a multiagent platform like JADE, for instance (however, at a much lower scale).
par
It is a container for several entities:

par
subsubsectionOCOPProblem - the optimization problem
labelOCOPProblem
This object is created at the initialization of the environment.
The normal way to create such an object is from a text file that contains the description of the problem, in DPOP format.
This is done by calling the static method textttOCOPProblem.loadFromFile(fileName).
par
This object contains a complete representation of the optimization problem to be solved: a list of nodes, variables and constraints/relations.
It features a number of convenience methods like finding a node/variable by id, finding neighbors of a node, etc.
par
Please note that while this is a centralized/complete representation of the optimization problem, it is not available to any of the agents.
The agents are handed just their own subproblems, without having any global knowledge about the overall problem.

sectionImplementing your own agent system/optimization algorithm
labelimplementation
The framework is flexible and powerful enough to allow an experienced user to extend it and implement any distributed optimization algorithm.
par
We provide an example implementation of DPOP, an optimization algorithm recently introduced in citePetcu2005.
In the following we will give step-by-step instructions for implementing any optimization lgorithm, and analyze the corresponding step from the example implementation of DPOP.
par
subsectionMain class
labelmainClass
par
This is the main class of the program.
Its task is to load the environment class, instruct it to load the OCOPProblem from a file, create a distributed reprezentation of the problem, create the agents and populate the environment, and instruct the environment to start the agents.
par
The DPOP equivalent is texttttestbed.OCOP.DPOP.TesterDPOP.
subsectionOCOPAgent class
labelagentClass
par
This represents an agent from the system.
Normally it should extend textttOCOPAbstractAgent, which provides basic functionality (listing neighbors, sending messages, etc).
par
The DPOP equivalent is texttttestbed.OCOP.DPOP.OCOPAgent.
par
It performs a initalization sequence, and then the main thread is started.
par

beginitemize
item sends any initial messages
item waits for notifications of message receival from the message handlers, and processes the incoming messages according to algorithm
item builds outgoing messages for (some of) its neighbors and gives them to the mailman
item until algorithm is finished;
item then, announce textttEnvironment that it is finished, and exit
enditemize
par
Each agent has a number of message queues and message handlers, one for each type of message that is required by the protocol (the optimization algorithm).
For each message type, the agent has a textttprocessMessage method that is invoked by the corresponding message handler when a new message of that type is received.
The logic in these methods, together with the interplay between the various message sending/processing phases are actually the implementation of the optimization algorithm.
par
In the case of DPOP, there are 3 such methods: textttprocessTOPO(), textttprocessUTILS() and textttprocessVALUE(), corresponding to DPOP's 3 message types (textitTOPO, textitUTIL and textitVALUE).
These methods are called by the corresponding message handlers upon receiving/parsing a message and constructing the object corresponding to its payload (textttHandleIncomingTOPOMessageBehaviour, etc).
par
subsectionMessage handlers
labelhandler
Examples are texttttestbed.OCOP.DPOP.behaviours.HandleIncomingTOPOMessageBehaviour, or texttttestbed.OCOP.DPOP.behaviours.HandleIncomingUTILMessageBehaviour, or texttttestbed.OCOP.DPOP.behaviours.HandleIncomingVALUEMessageBehaviour.
par
They extend the MessageQueueProcessor class.
Their purpose is to be attached to a message queue, and wait until a new message is added to that queue by the textttMailMan.
When this happens, they parse the message, building the corresponding object out of the serialization from the message (e.g. a textttMessageContext from a textitTOPO message, or a textttHyperCube from a textitUTIL message).
Then, they pass this object to the corresponding method of the agent, which will process it (e.g. textttprocessTOPO, or textttprocessUTIL).
sectionDPOP specific details
par
The flow of the algorithm is given by the succession of the 3 phases (textitTOPO, textitUTIL and textitVALUE) which is implemented in OCOPAgent.run(), and the message passing which is handled by the message handlers (textttHandleIncomingTOPOMessageBehaviour, etc which handle incoming messages), and by the testbed.communication.MessageSender object that sends outgoing messages to the MailMan.
par
subsectiontextitDFS creation
labelDFS
par
This is the first phase of the DPOP algorithm.
par
The node chosen as root initiates this phase by sending a token to one of its neighbors.
A token is a textitTOPO message which contains the id's of the nodes that were visited by the token.
par
This phase is performed by all nodes by calling the textttpseudotreeConstruction() method of OCOPAgent.
TOPO messages are received by texttttestbed.OCOP.DPOP.behaviours.HandleIncomingTOPOMessageBehaviour, which builds the payload of the message (the MessageContext object) out of the serialization, and then calls the textttprocessTOPO method of the agent.
par
A node finishes this phase when it has received a token from all its neighbors.
Then, it engages in the second phase.
par
subsectiontextitUTIL propagation
labelUTIL
par
This phase is initiated when the previous one finishes.
Each node waits for all textitUTIL messages from its children to be received, then computes its outgoing message (see below for details), and then sends it to its parent.
par
UTIL messages are received by texttttestbed.OCOP.DPOP.behaviours.HandleIncomingUTILMessageBehaviour, which builds the payload of the message (the HyperCube object) out of the serialization, and then calls the textttprocessUTIL method of the agent.
par
subsubsectionHypercubes and generic operations on hypercubes
par
Modeled by textttDPOP.HyperCube.
par
We define hypercubes as matrices with 0 or more dimensions.
A hypercube without any dimension is just a number, one with 1 dimension is a vector, etc.
The mapping between an n-ary constraint and a hypercube with n dimensions is straightforward: the variables involved in the constraint are the dimensions of the hypercube, and the valuation of each tuple of the constraint is recorded in the corresponding cell of the hypercube.
We define below a number of operations on hypercubes, which we will use in the algorithms.

Upon receipt of the textitVALUE message from its parent, each node is able to pick the optimal value for itself according to one of the strategies from equations refeq:value_optimistic or refeq:value_delta.
par
Equation refeq:value_optimistic selects as the optimal value the one with the highest upper bound, even though it may not necessarily provide the best guarantees on solution quality (in case its lower bound is low).
We call this textitoptimistic strategy.

This phase is equivalent to the solution reconstruction phase from the bucket elimination scheme (see citedechter97bucket,Dechter2003).

Our experiments were performed on distributed meeting scheduling problems.
sectionConclusions and future work
We propose in this paper an approximate algorithm for distributed optimization, which allows the desired tradeoff between solution quality and computational complexity.
In the second part of the paper we present an anytime version of the first algorithm, which provides increasingly accurate solutions while the propagation is still in progress.
This makes it suitable for very large, distributed problems, where propagations may take a long time to complete.
The anytime algorithm also exhibits some built-in fault-tolerance features, by graceful degradation of performance upon message loss.
Experimental results show that these algorithms are a viable approach to real world, loose, possibly unbounded optimization problems.
par
Future work includes finding heuristics for generating DFS trees with low induced width, selecting "intelligently" the dimensions to be dropped out when exceeding maximal message size, and finding correlations between <IMG

 ALT="$maxDims$">, <IMG
 WIDTH="74" HEIGHT="15" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img42.png"
 ALT="$maxErrorBound$"> and final solution quality.
Fault tolerance tests on the degradation of performance in case of message loss are also planned.
We strongly believe that these methods would give good results also in much larger problems, with thousands of agents, variables and constraints, and plan a systematic evaluation for the near future.
